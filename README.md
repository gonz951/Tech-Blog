# Tech-Blog

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-License-green)

## Description

The tech blog was made in order for us to test out handlebars and how to connect routes to handlebars. I learned that routes aren't very forgiving and are very finicky, almost fragile. Despite this, I got the 'new post' function working.

## Installation

If one were to try and get this running locally, they would have to install the packages, create the database, create an .env, etc. However, there is a Render link:
